        window.ENGINE  = {}; //all the functions that start up and run the engine itself
        window.VIEW    = {}; //This contains all the functions for drawing in the DOM

        window.MODULES = {}; //This contains all objects that define a module. MAP_GRID, PARTY, etc.

        window.HISTORY = {}; //This contains all functions that run the history engine
        window.STORAGE = {}; //This contains all functions that run the file storage system used by the saves
        window.SAVES   = {}; //This contains all functions that run the save system

        //Should STATE be a part of the HAE?
        window.STATE   = {}; //This contains all functions that run the state system, for things like CELL_DATA, GAME_DATA, etc.
        window.HAE     = {}; //This contains the game itself. When someone makes a game, it's info goes in here.

        //Maybe I should make it so instead of having HAE point at the game, I make HAE point at the story format
        //And add GAME to point at the game itself
        //Then reformat all access to HAE_PROCESSOR/BUILDER/PARSER to be through an intermediate STORY_ACCESSOR system
        //So the keys become STORY and GAME, and STORY is passed "HAE" by the game, causing STORY to load HAE
        //All current calls to HAE inside my codebase would be replaced with STORY.has_cell() or whatever is needed
        //
        //TLDR:
        //HAE becomes GAME
        //The HAE_Files stay an HAE, but declare themselves as an HAE, and are not directly accessed by anything but STORY
        //STORY is the accessor into what is currently labelled HAE/Futurely labelled GAME
