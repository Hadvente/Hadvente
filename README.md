### HTML Adventure Engine

This is a game engine designed for creating Text Adventure games through HTML and Javascript.  
The system is meant to be modular, with the ability to drop in Module files to render new cells on the GUI.  
The main file that describes your game is called the HAE file, and it describes all the scenes, locations, and other systems in the GUI.
